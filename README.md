# Welcome to Lakad

This is an application output for our thesis.

## Quick Setup
1. Clone the project
   ```
      git clone https://github.com/niceWizzard/thesis-lakad-rn
   ```
2. Make a .env.local file in the root of the project. Paste the secret keys to it (will be given by me).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Make the prebuild

   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild --clean
   ```

3. Run the project. Make sure there is an available device
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
  ```
